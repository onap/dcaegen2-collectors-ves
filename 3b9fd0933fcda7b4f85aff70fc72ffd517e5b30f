      "message": "I would be careful on this one.\n\nMost of the time that a config variable like this was made protected is when it really needed to be accessed in a derived class.\n\nThis needs to be verified by others who have created such derived classes. It also needs to be verified against existing code to make certain that nothing using it breaks.\n\nIf access truly is needed, an accessor function may be appropriate.",

      "message": "I do agree with you. But I found this config variable is used only with in the same class, not anywhere else. And sonar reported this as an issue. \nI hope this can be merged now and later if someone need this config in derived class can change from private to protected and use it. If there is a usage outside this class, then I think sonar won\u0027t report this as an issue again.",
