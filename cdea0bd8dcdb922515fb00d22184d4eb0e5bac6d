When someone, in the future or by accident, will change the order of method invocation, for example: startListening... then startApplication, I want to be sure that application will still work correctly. That is why I used ReentrantLock.",

      "message": "Main method could also be marked as synchronized, then current behaviour would be the same I think, but I guess for the main method it\u0027s easier to notice the usage of lock.\n\nBut one thing for restartApplication(). Now the lock is unlocked before the restart happens, is this intended? I think it would be possible to call restartApplication multiple times, and multiple threads reloading app would run at the same time. Shouldn\u0027t the underlying thread hold the lock?",
